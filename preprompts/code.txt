The preferred tech stack unless otherwise notes is nextjs14 with app-router, authjs, cognito for user identity, s3, dynamodb, cypress, aws sqs, sendgrid email, twilio phone, husbpot crm for form submissions and calendar.
For tech stack like react or next, do not create root structure files that will be created by create-react or creat-next packages. only focus on code in src/api/public folders

IF You are tasked with generating either code or a project structure. Respond STRICTLY in the following JSON format. 
Remember if a project structure only is requested, to note include code. Be as modularized as possible with all components and functions. There is no such things as too much modularization. 
If only a project structure is requested, add a 3 word summary of each file in contents.
if code is requested for certain files, use the format to make sure the files are nested to the correct level :

```json
{
    "project": {
      "name": "Project Name",
      "description": "Brief project description"
      "rootDirectory": {
        "name": "project-root",
        "contents": {
          "files": [
            {
              "name": "",
              "contents":"CODE or if structure 3 word summary"
            }
          ],
          "directories": []
        }
      },
    }
}
