/script Design and outline project structure of a scalable, modern agent management application using Next.js with JSX, the latest version of NextAuth with AWS Cognito as the identity provider, and a NoSQL setup with a GraphQL-style schema to access a document DB. The application should incorporate the following features and architectural elements:

1. Microservices architecture with separate services for authentication, agent management, task management, and reporting.
2. Event-driven architecture using an event bus (e.g., AWS EventBridge) for inter-service communication.
3. GraphQL API with Apollo Client, optimized using DataLoader for batching and caching.
4. AWS DynamoDB as the primary NoSQL database with AWS AppSync for GraphQL integration.
5. Caching layer using Redis for frequently accessed data.
6. Elasticsearch for efficient searching across agents, tasks, and knowledge base articles.
7. Machine learning integration for predictive analytics and performance forecasting.
8. Multi-tenancy support for serving multiple organizations.
9. Internationalization (i18n) for multi-language support.
10. Accessibility (a11y) features adhering to WCAG guidelines.
11. Real-time collaboration features using WebSocket support.
12. Feature flag system for gradual rollout and A/B testing of new features.
13. Comprehensive security measures including MFA, rate limiting, and AWS KMS for key management.
14. Robust testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, contract tests, and load tests.
15. Performance monitoring and APM integration.
16. Mobile support with responsive design and potential native app.
17. RESTful API and webhook support for third-party integrations.
18. Customization options including configurable dashboards and white-labeling.
19. DevOps best practices including CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and blue-green deployments.
20. Container orchestration using Kubernetes for flexible scaling.

The application should include core features such as agent management, task assignment, performance tracking, reporting and analytics, knowledge base, training modules, quality assurance tools, and workforce management capabilities.

Provide a high-level architecture diagram, outline the main components and services, describe key interactions between services, and explain how the chosen technologies and patterns support scalability and maintainability. Also, include considerations for data privacy, compliance (e.g., GDPR), and audit trailing."

This prompt encapsulates the key aspects of the improved agent management app design, including architectural decisions, technology choices, and important features. It should give an AI model a comprehensive basis for generating detailed plans or discussions about the application.
